                        I grew up in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. As a young person, my favorite hobby was reading. I have always loved to draw, especially monsters and fantastical beasts. Until my junior year of college I always believed in a deep, secret part of my mind that I really was an alien, and that someday my alien family would come and take me home to a beautiful and peaceful world. Then I accepted that I really am just a human, and I will only ever live on Earth in my vulnerable human body. That's okay, though, because the Earth is also really beautiful, and so is having a human body. I get better at it every day.
